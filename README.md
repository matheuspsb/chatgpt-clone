# ChatGPT Clone

As part of this project, I aim to replicate the interface and functionality of ChatGPT, showcasing my proficiency in building real-time chat applications with streaming responses.

## Objective

My goal was to create a responsive and interactive user interface that closely mimicked ChatGPT, providing users with the ability to engage in a simulated conversation with streaming responses.

### Technologies:

- React will serve as the primary framework.
- TypeScript will ensure type safety.
- I utilized Tailwind CSS for styling.

### Interface Replication:

- I meticulously recreated the ChatGPT chatbox interface with a clean and user-friendly design.
- Ensuring responsiveness across various screen sizes was a top priority.

### Chat Functionality:

- Users were able to input messages seamlessly.
- Responses were displayed in a conversation-style format, maintaining the illusion of a real chat.
- Implementing streaming responses ensured a smooth and real-time conversation flow.

### Streaming Response:

- I employed an asynchronous approach for streaming responses, enhancing user experience.
- Including typing indicators during the delay between user input and responses added to the authenticity of the conversation.

### Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository and set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

        https://github.com/matheuspsb/chatgpt-clone.git

2. Navigate to the project directory
   
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project if it doesn't already exist.

4. Inside the `.env` file, insert your OpenAI API key following the structure in `.env.example`:

    ```plaintext
    REACT_APP_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ```

5. Save the .env file.

6. You're now ready to run the project locally! Use the appropriate commands to start the development server based on your setup.

#### By following these steps, you'll ensure that your ChatGPT clone has access to the OpenAI API for generating responses.
